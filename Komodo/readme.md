## Komodo
Komodo is a web app for managing servers, builds, deployments, and automation. It supports unlimited servers, Docker container control, Compose deployments via UI or Git, auto-built images, AWS instances, and full env/secret managementâ€”no limits or paid tiers. It is an alternative to Portainer and Dockge, but goes beyond container management by integrating build pipelines, server metrics, and automation workflows into a single platform.

If your interested in migrating your containers and stacks check out the excellent blog by FoxxMD https://blog.foxxmd.dev/posts/migrating-to-komodo/

I have created a couple of custom api widgets for home page.
