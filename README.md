# Dashboard Customisations

A personal collection of tools to enhance home dashboarding projects.

- 🎨 [**Glance CSS theme for other apps**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/blob/main/Glance%2FREADME.md) for consistent look.
- 🧩 [**Custom widgets**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/blob/main/Komodo%2Freadme.md) for [get-homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/).
- 🖼️ [**Custom icons**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/tree/main/icons) for better visual consistency

This repo brings together tweaks, styles, and widgets I've built to improve the look, feel, and usability of my self-hosted dashboards.
