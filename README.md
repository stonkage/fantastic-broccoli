# Dashboard Customisations

A personal collection of tools to enhance home dashboarding projects.

- 🎨 [**Custom Glance CSS**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/tree/main/Glance) for a cleaner, more modern dashboard look
- 🧩 [**Custom widgets**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/tree/main/Komodo) for Komodo and other dashboard tools
- 🖼️ [**Custom icons**](https://github.com/stonkage/fantastic-broccoli/tree/main/icons) for better visual consistency

This repo brings together tweaks, styles, and widgets I've built to improve the look, feel, and usability of my self-hosted dashboards.
