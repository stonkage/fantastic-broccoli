## Komodo
Komodo is a web app for managing servers, builds, deployments, and automation. It supports unlimited servers, Docker container control, Compose deployments via UI or Git, auto-built images, AWS instances, and full env/secret managementâ€”no limits or paid tiers. Unlike alternatives like Portainer or Dockge, Komodo goes beyond container management by integrating build pipelines, server metrics, and automation workflows into a single platform.
